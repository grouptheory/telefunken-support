makeConfigurationGraph(d)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{a vector of degrees for each node}

A matrix with 3 columns and length(d) rows,
with each row representing an edge. Edges are from
the first column to the second column, with the third column
indicating whether the edge is reciprocated (1 -> reciprocated, 0 -> directed).
